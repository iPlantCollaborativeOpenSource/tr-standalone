==INTRODUCTION
iPlant's Tree Reconciliation Viewer allows visual searches of reconciled tree data from a variety of entry points. 

This is alpha code. It worked when we ran it, but no guarantees of any kind are made that it will work for anyone else anywhere.

More information about iPlant's Open Source policies and current status is available at http://iplantcollaborative.org/about/policies/open-source

An update to this README is in progress.
